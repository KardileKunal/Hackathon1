                <h6>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h6>
                <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn’t end
                    with neckties, PCs, or big corporations.
                    It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done,
                    or it’s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued,
                    we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design,
                    both
                    large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don’t,
                    and
                    more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a
                    culture
                    of design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

                <h6>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h6>
                <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written
                    narrative and effective storytelling technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To
                    do so they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention,
                    emphasize
                    information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical
                    aspects
                    used in film to communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat
                    sheets,
                    and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.

                <p>
                    Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication,
                    creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years

                    matter
                    how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to
                    its
                    success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at adamconnor.com and

                <h6>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h6>
                <p>Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping makes things a little better by
                    allowing you to stitch together static wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid
                    prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster; it increases collaboration and
                    improves the iteration process. Kill your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.
